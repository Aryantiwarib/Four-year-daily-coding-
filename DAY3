# LOGIC BEHIND THIS CODE

# CREATE DIC IN WHICH ADD THE COUNT OF EVERY CHARACTER 
# f.get(i, 0) + 1 WE USE THIS SO THAT TIME LIMIT IS NOT Exceeded..
# in this f.get() it is use to get the i key element if the element is not exist int the dic then it asign the value of
# that by 0 and plus one to asign value one and if the element in the dic then this increse the count of that 
# element by one Thank you ..

# set(f.keys()) WE USE THIS INSIDE THE WHILE LOOP WE CREATE THIS SET BY USING KEYS BECAUSE ONLY THOSE
# WE DELETE THOSE ELEMENT THOSE PRESENT IN THE DIC
