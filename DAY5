   # LOGIC BEHIND THIS QUESTION 
    # Both x and y have the bit set to 0.
    # Both x and y have the bit set to 1.
    # One of x or y has the bit set to 1, while the other has the bit set to 0.
    # So, for each bit position, we have three choices, resulting in a total of 3^A
    #  possibilities. This forms the basis of the solution.
